        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          NearLuk values the privacy of its users and is dedicated to
          safeguarding their information. This Privacy Policy outlines the
          practices concerning the collection, utilization, disclosure, and
          transmission of user data by NearLuk Technologies Private Limited
          and/or its subsidiary(ies) and/or affiliate(s) (hereinafter referred
          to as "Company"), which operates a variety of websites, sub-sites,
          applications, and mobile-web platforms (collectively referred to as
          "Sites") to provide information, products, offerings, and content
          through internet-connected devices or other means (collectively
          referred to as "Services").
        </p>
        <p>
          This Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Use and other related
          terms mentioned on the Site ("Terms of Use"). The Policy is effective
          from the moment a user registers on our platform and accepts the
          specified terms and conditions. Before using our services, we
          encourage users to carefully read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
          Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          NearLuk respects the privacy of its users and strives to create a
          secure and enriching online experience. To achieve this, NearLuk
          collects two types of information: (a) Details provided directly by
          users and (b) Information automatically tracked during navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using NearLuk's website or availing its services, you consent to
          the collection, storage, usage, transfer, sharing, and distribution of
          the personal information you provide (including any updates provided
          by you) for any of the services offered by NearLuk.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Received, Collected, and Stored by NearLuk</h3>
        <h5>
          <strong>User-provided information:</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          When you sign up for NearLuk's services on our platform, we will
          request certain basic contact details such as your name, gender, age,
          address, postal code, contact number, occupation, interests, and email
          address. If you choose to register using your social media accounts
          like Facebook, Twitter, or Gmail, we will access relevant information
          from those accounts to maintain interaction with you and continue
          offering our services.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>User's location usage:</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          We collect or access user location to provide personalized property
          and commercial space recommendations based on user preferences and
          location. This enhances the property search experience by offering
          relevant listings in the desired vicinity.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>Subscription and paid service data:</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you opt for any subscription or paid service offered through
          NearLuk, we, or our trusted payment gateway provider, may collect
          necessary purchase and billing information, including your credit card
          number and expiration date. However, for in-app purchases made through
          the company's applications, the transaction will be handled by the
          respective mobile operating system platform providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that subscription services may be set to auto-renewal by
          default. If you would like to stop the auto-renewal, you may do so at
          any time before your subscription term ends.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>Voluntary information:</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          At times, we might request additional information from you,
          voluntarily, such as when you provide feedback, comments, update your
          content or email preferences, participate in surveys, or engage in any
          other communications with us. You can be sure that such information
          will be collected with your permission and handled in line with our
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Collection and Tracking During Navigation</h3>
        <h5>Cookies - Understanding user interests:</h5>
        <p>
          NearLuk uses "cookies" and similar electronic tools to enhance the
          responsiveness of its website for users. These cookies assign a
          unique, random number known as a User Identification (User ID) to each
          visitor's computer or device. This helps NearLuk understand individual
          user interests based on their interactions with the Site or Service.
          It's important to note that unless you provide personal information
          voluntarily (e.g., through registration), NearLuk won't know your
          identity even if a cookie is assigned to your computer or device.
          Cookies cannot access data on your hard drive or device. Additionally,
          NearLuk's advertisers may also employ their own cookies in processes
          outside of NearLuk's control. Whenever you engage with NearLuk through
          its website or service on your computer, laptop, netbook, mobile,
          tablet, pad, or handheld device, certain types of information are
          automatically received and stored.
        </p>
        <h5>Opting out of tracking:</h5>
        <p>
          Users have the option to opt out using the Ads Settings. If a user
          chooses to opt out, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on their browser
          will be replaced with the term "Opt Out." Consequently, the opt-out
          cookie will no longer be associated with any specific browser.
        </p>
        <h5>Automatic collection of log file information:</h5>
        <p>
          When you visit the NearLuk website, application, or service, limited
          information about your computer's internet connection, including your
          IP address, may be automatically collected. An IP address is a
          numerical label that enables computers on the internet to send data to
          your device, such as the web pages you access. Additionally, NearLuk
          receives and logs information from your browser, including your IP
          address, location, device name, serial number, or unique
          identification number, device operating system, browser type and
          version, CPU speed, and connection speed.
        </p>
        <h5>Using clear GIFs (Web Beacons):</h5>
        <p>
          NearLuk may utilize "Clear GIFs" or Web Beacons to anonymously track
          the online usage patterns of its users. These clear GIFs may also be
          included in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are
          opened. This information is used to deliver web pages upon request,
          personalize the Sites or Services to user interests, measure traffic
          to improve the quality, functionality, and interactivity of NearLuk's
          Sites, as well as provide advertisers with geographic location data
          without personally identifying individual users.
        </p>
        <h5>Receiving Information from External Sources:</h5>
        <p>
          We might receive additional information about you from external
          sources, which we will combine with the data we already have. We
          handle this information in line with our privacy policy. If you've
          provided information to the platform provider or any other partner
          with whom we collaborate, they may share your account and order
          details with us.
        </p>
        <h5>Utilizing demographic and external data:</h5>
        <p>
          To offer you more personalized communications and promotions, we may
          refer to external sources for demographic and other related data.
          Among the tools we use is Google Analytics, which helps us track user
          behavior on our websites. This includes understanding our users'
          interests and demographics for display advertising purposes. Don't
          worryâ€”the reports are completely anonymous and cannot be linked to any
          personally identifiable information you may have shared with us. If
          you prefer not to participate in Google Analytics for display
          advertising, you can customize Google Display Network ads using
          Google's Ads Settings.
        </p>
        <h5>Third-party links and advertisements:</h5>
        <p>
          Our Sites may contain links to external websites or applications, and
          their privacy policies are beyond our control. Once you leave our
          Site, any information you provide is subject to the privacy policy of
          the visited site or application, which may differ from ours. If you
          can't find the privacy policy of any linked Site, please contact the
          application owners directly for more information.
        </p>
        <h5>Information usage by NearLuk:</h5>
        <p>
          The data you provide enables us to enhance our services and offer you
          a user-friendly experience. Some services or utilities may require
          your contact address. We use this user information to maintain,
          protect, and improve our services, including personalized
          advertisements on the Sites, as well as to develop new services.
          Occasionally, we may use your email or other personally identifiable
          information to send marketing messages about our services and updates
          on third-party products and services, with an option to subscribe or
          unsubscribe. However, we also use your email for non-marketing
          purposes, such as notifying you of significant changes or for customer
          service and billing purposes.
        </p>
        <div className="nearluk__public__information">
          <h5>Publicly available information:</h5>
          <p>
            Any personally identifiable information freely available and
            accessible in the public domain, such as comments, messages, blogs
            on social platforms like Facebook or Twitter, is not considered
            sensitive under this policy. Content posted, uploaded, or
            communicated by users in the public sections of our Sites becomes
            published content and is not subject to this policy as personally
            identifiable information.
          </p>
          <h5>Importance of providing personal information:</h5>
          <p>
            Declining to submit personally identifiable information on our Sites
            may result in the unavailability of certain services. We will make
            reasonable efforts to inform you about this when you create your
            account. However, we will not be liable or responsible for the
            denial of certain services due to a lack of necessary personal
            information.
          </p>
          <h5>Updates and communication:</h5>
          <p>
            When you register with our Sites or Services, we may periodically
            contact you to update your personal information and offer features
            that we believe may benefit or interest you as a user.

          details like your name, address, email, or phone number, to present
          advertisements personalized to your interests based on your
          interactions with specific websites, mobile applications, or services.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Approach to Information Sharing with Third Parties</h4>

            We may share information within our group of companies and their

            rights or platform.

        <h4>Accessing and Updating Personal Information with NearLuk</h4>
        <p>
          When utilizing the Services or Sites (including any sub-sites),
          NearLuk endeavors to grant you access to your personal information
          upon request. We are committed to rectifying any inaccuracies or
          deficiencies in your personal information or sensitive data, wherever
          possible, unless required to retain such data by law or for legitimate
          business reasons. To process such requests, we kindly ask individual
          users to provide identification and specify the information they wish
          to access, correct, or remove.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we reserve the right to decline requests that are
          unreasonably repetitive or systematic, demand disproportionate
          technical effort, compromise the privacy of others, or are highly
          impractical (such as requests regarding information stored on backup
          tapes), or when access is not mandatory. If we do provide information
          access and correction, this service is generally offered free of
          charge, except in cases where it would necessitate a disproportionate
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that certain services may require some time to remove
          residual copies of your data from our active servers and backup
          systems, even after you have deleted the information.
        </p>
        <h4>Information Security Measures</h4>
        <p>
          NearLuk prioritizes information security by implementing appropriate
          measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
          destruction of data. Our internal processes involve regular reviews of
          data collection, storage, and processing practices, with a focus on
          robust security measures such as encryption and physical safeguards.
          Personal data collected on NearLuk is securely stored within our
          company-controlled database, which is protected by firewalls and
          restricted access through password protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite our diligent efforts, it's essential to recognize that no
          security system can be entirely impervious. While we strive to ensure
          the security of our database, we cannot guarantee absolute protection
          against potential breaches. Therefore, we advise users that
          information transmitted to us over the internet may be susceptible to
          interception or unprecedented hacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, NearLuk engages third-party advertising companies to
          display ads on our Sites or Services. These companies may use
          non-personally identifiable information about your visits and usage of
          specific websites, applications, or services to deliver advertisements
          that align with your interests. You can be sure that your name,
          address, email address, and phone number are excluded from this data
          usage.
        </p>
        <h4>Account Deactivation and Reactivation</h4>
        <p>
          User accounts inactive for a specific period will be deactivated. To
          reactivate, users need to verify their registered mobile number or
          email, ensuring account security and reactivation upon user request.
          We do not offer a direct account deletion feature.
        </p>
        <h4>Updates or Changes of the Policy</h4>
        <p>
          NearLuk acknowledges that the internet is a dynamic platform that
          constantly evolves. Therefore, we may modify our Policy as needed to
          accommodate technological advancements, changes in applicable laws, or
          any other relevant factors. We retain the right to alter the terms of
          this Policy or the Terms of Use at any time. Such changes will take
          effect immediately upon notification, which we will provide by
          publishing the updated policy on our website. By continuing to use
          NearLuk's Sites or Services after such notice, you agree to accept
          these modifications. Additionally, we will make reasonable efforts to
          inform you of any significant changes via electronic mail. We
          recommend that you regularly review this Policy on our Site to stay
          informed about the latest version.
